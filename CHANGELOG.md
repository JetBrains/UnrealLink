# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0). Note that this project does not follow semantic versioning but uses version numbers based on JetBrains [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) releases.

This plugin contains a plugin for the Unreal Editor (RiderLink) that is used to communicate with Rider. Changes marked with a "Rider:" prefix are specific to Rider, while changes for the Unreal Editor plugin are marked with a "Unreal Editor:" prefix. No prefix means that the change is common to both Rider and ReSharper.

The plugin is always bundled with Rider.
