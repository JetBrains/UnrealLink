<h1>Setting up development environment</h1>

<p>After cloning the repository, you need to perform some actions to set up the environment. Here is the easiest way to do it:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Run the console under the folder where you have cloned the repository.
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure that you have Java installed on your machine and you have environmental variable JAVA_HOME set to the value of the path to your JDK folder. Otherwise, it won't work.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the following command <code>gradlew buildResharperHost</code> to install all the requirements for proper work
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Here you go! Now you can open UnrealLink.sln and write your code.</p>
